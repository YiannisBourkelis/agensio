# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

**Breaking: strict host matching.** A site answers only the names in its `server_name`.
A request with any other Host, including the server's IP address, answers `421
Misdirected Request` unless the listener has a catch-all site (`server_name = ["*"]` or
`default = true`). Before, the first site on a listener silently served everything. If
your monitor checks the IP address, point it at the hostname or add a catch-all site.
The packaged default site on port 80 is a catch-all; port 443 has none unless you add one.

- TLS: each site on a listener gets its own certificate, selected by SNI (before, all
  sites shared the first site's certificate). A name no site lists is refused at the
  handshake; a client sending no name gets the catch-all's certificate or is refused.
- `status` names each listener's catch-all; `sites` marks catch-all sites; `site-create`
  warns when a listener has none.
- A log file added by a reload received nothing (per-worker buffers); fixed.
- `/var/lib/agensio` is 0751 so site users reach their own tmp/ and sessions/.
- Refused endings (`deny_suffixes`) answer 404 like hidden files.
- `agensio ctl --help`, and `--help` on every subcommand.

- Add A/B benchmark results and acceptance test for site creation
- docs: update installation instructions for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 (2026-09-19)

- feat: enhance release workflow to upload RPM artifacts and add Fedora smoke tests

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 (2026-09-19)

- fix: update release workflow to use secrets for APT GPG key and enhance Arch package build process

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 (2026-09-19)

Packages and release automation; no change to the server itself.

- Debian package (`.deb`) and RPM built by CPack: binary in `/usr/sbin`, systemd unit,
  log rotation, `/etc/agensio` with a default site serving `/var/www/html`, the
  `agensio` service account and the `agensio-admin` group, start on first install when
  port 80 is free. Upgrades keep edited configuration files; purge keeps certificates
  and content. `tests/package.sh` exercises the whole cycle in a container.
- `packaging/rpm/agensio.spec` for COPR and `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD` for the AUR.
- GitHub Actions: `ci.yml` builds and tests on Ubuntu and macOS; `release.yml` builds
  both packages on every `v*` tag, checks the version against the tag, attaches the
  packages to the release and publishes a signed APT repository to GitHub Pages when the
  signing key secret is present.
- `scripts/release.sh` bumps the version everywhere, tags and pushes.
- `docs/install.md`: the package routes for Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 (2026-09-19)

First pre-alpha. Everything below is implemented and tested on Linux (Debian 13) and
macOS; Windows compiles but is not tested. Read `docs/install.md` before installing and
`README.md` for the known limitations.

### Serving
- Static files over HTTP/1.1 and HTTPS with an in-memory cache, sendfile, Range requests,
  conditional requests, per-site locations, `try_files`, path policies.
- PHP through FastCGI with presets for Laravel, Statamic (`laravel`), WordPress and plain
  PHP; per-site users with generated php-fpm pools and ownership rules checked by `-t`.
- Reverse proxy with WebSockets, upstream groups with passive health checks, TLS to the
  origin, header policy, CGI; presets and examples for Node, Rails, Rocket.Chat,
  ThingsBoard.
- Access log in combined or JSON format, error log, `SIGUSR1` reopen.

### Operating
- `agensio reload` (or `SIGHUP`): configuration switched between requests, nothing in
  flight interrupted, a bad file refused with the old configuration kept.
- `tls = "auto"`: built-in ACME client (HTTP-01) for Let's Encrypt or any RFC 8555 CA,
  renewal at a third of the lifetime left, the new certificate picked up through the
  reload path.
- `redirect = "https"` or `redirect = "https://www.example.com"` for HTTPS-only and
  canonical-host setups.
- Start as root, bind, then drop to `server.user`; per-site logs owned for the customer.

### Control plane
- `[control]`: a unix socket with peer-credential roles (admin, operator, viewer) and an
  audit log. Read commands: status, sites, site, validate, logs, health. Changes:
  reload, logs-reopen, site-create/update/disable/enable/delete, cert-renew, every one
  behind an explicit confirmation and a reason.
- `agensio ctl` for shells and panels.
- `agensio mcp`: a Model Context Protocol server on stdio for AI agent hosts, locally
  or over SSH, with the same tools gated by role; a guided site creation that asks for
  the decisions it needs and hands root work back as commands.
- Security review of the control plane in `docs/security-control-plane.md`.

### Performance
Single worker on Linux against nginx: about 1.5x less CPU per plain request, 1.3-1.6x
on TLS, proxying 13-46 % cheaper; numbers and method in `CLAUDE.md` and `bench/results/`.
